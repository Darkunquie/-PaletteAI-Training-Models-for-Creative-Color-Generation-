# Train a Model to Generate Colors

## Project Overview

Learn Machine Learning and AI by building the project "Train a Model to Generate Colors." This project utilizes concepts and technologies like Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Numpy, and more to create a model that generates unique and aesthetically pleasing color palettes. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding machine learning principles while exploring the fascinating world of color theory.

## Features

- **Color Generation**: Generate unique color palettes based on learned patterns.
- **Model Training**: Train a neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilize Numpy for efficient data handling.
- **Visualization**: Visualize generated colors and palettes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API for building and training models.
- **TensorFlow**: The backend for Keras, used for model training and evaluation.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing color palettes.
